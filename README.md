# 🚀 TripGenius – Smart Travel Planning Application

TripGenius is a web-based smart travel planning application that generates optimized, day-wise travel itineraries using AI-inspired, rule-based logic. The project focuses on intelligent trip planning by analyzing user inputs such as destination, trip duration, and preferences, without handling bookings.

This repository showcases practical skills in backend logic design, modular web architecture, version control, and cloud-ready application development, making it suitable for academic evaluation and professional portfolios.

## 🧠 Design & Engineering Notes
This project was designed with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and future scalability. The system structure intentionally separates user interface, backend processing, and decision logic to ensure maintainability and ease of extension.

While the current implementation focuses on rule-based planning, the architecture supports seamless integration of advanced AI/ML models, external APIs, and cloud-native services in future iterations. Development decisions were made to balance simplicity, clarity, and real-world applicability, aligning with modern software engineering best practices.
